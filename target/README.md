# Target App

I will [Objective] as measured by [this set of Key Results]

Target is an Android based application to help personal user with their life objectives. It uses Objective Key Result (OKR) as its methodology to help users achieve and manage their goals.

I have used Google Tasks and think that it is a life saver. As I use it everyday, sometimes I like to write down some quick and short objectives, and I realize that I can't maximize the productivity. One is I can't write down what is the goal from the objective, how to measure them or what is the achievments. Last, what's behind the goal and its rationality.

So here we can see the high fidelity UI. It uses Material.io and Google Tasks as the reference.
